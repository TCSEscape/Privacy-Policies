Privacy Policy for Cryptic
Effective Date: January 1, 2026
Thank you for using Cryptic ("the App"). This Privacy Policy is here to help you understand what information the App stores and how it is used.

1. Information We Collect and Store
Cryptic is designed to be a completely offline experience. All data generated and used by the App is stored exclusively on your own device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal information on our servers or any third-party servers.
The information stored locally on your device includes:
• Game Progress: This includes your current level in the Adventure Mode, which puzzles you have completed, and which in-game awards you have unlocked.
• User-Generated Content: Notes you write in the in-game notepad and your attempted solutions for puzzles are saved to your device. This is done to preserve your progress so you can resume a puzzle at a later time.
• Settings: Your preferences, such as music and sound effect volume, are saved locally.
• Character Selection: Your chosen investigator character is saved on your device.

2. How We Use Your Information
The information stored on your device is used solely for the functionality of the App:
• To save and restore your game state.
• To allow you to continue working on a puzzle without losing your notes or attempts.
• To remember your audio and other settings.
• To track your progress through the adventure map.
Absolutely no data is ever transmitted off your device by the App.

3. Data Security
All data is stored in the App's private directory on your device's internal storage, which is protected by the Android operating system. This data is deleted if you uninstall the App.

4. Children's Privacy
Cryptic does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children. The App is designed for a general audience, and all data remains on the user's device regardless of their age.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
